### Introduction
This is the code repository for the Heatmap Regulation (HR) paper [Improving Object Counting with Heatmap Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05494). Download the pretrained models from this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qPjB8QaYOLofUUzgz4Mc9iY6e40DpjKy).

##### Note that the GAP-GAS models actually refer to the HR models in this repo.

### Prerequisites
1. Python2.7
2. PyTorch v0.2.0_3 _(Models are trained on this version)_

### Code Overview

Codes for each of the datasets are into separate sub-directories inside the 'codes/' directory. Also, put all datasets in the corresponding sub-directories inside 'data/'
directory. Please follow the readme inside each code sub-directory to train and test the models.
